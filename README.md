<div align='center'><h1>About the project</h1></div>

<p><b>CPwatcher</b> was created in order to be able to measure how healthy a person walks. Three categories were created <b>Normal</b>, <b>CP1</b> and <b>CP2</b> with CP2 being the worst and normal the best. In order to achieve this classification, a sensor had to be used and a model to be created. The chosen sensor was <a href='https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nicla-sense-me'>Nicla Sense ME</a> and the chosen platform to build the model was <a href='https://edgeimpulse.com/'>Edge Impulse</a>. After the model was built, it got deployed on the sensor so that live classification can happen. All the sensor programming happened with the help of <a href=''>Arduino IDE</a> and <a href='https://platformio.org/'>PlatformIO IDE</a>.</p>

<p>In order to view and collect the data a web app was created. This was created by using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node.js) stack. The connection between the app and the sensor happens via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The app lets the user create an account, add patients, collect data for each patient and track their improvement over time.</p>
